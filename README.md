# Google Cyclistic Case Study
This is a case study part of Google Data Analytic certificate. In this project, I will be using SQL and Tableau to clean and analyze the data and follow Google’s 6 steps in data analysis: ask, prepare, clean and process, analyze, share, and act.

# Background

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
